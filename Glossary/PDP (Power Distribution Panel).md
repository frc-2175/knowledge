The PDP takes 12V DC input directly from the [[Battery|battery]], and outputs 12V DC power to motors and other actuators. It also has dedicated power output ports for the [[roboRIO]], [[VRM (Voltage Regulator Module)|VRM]], and [[PCM (Pneumatics Control Module)|PCM]]. The PDP also monitors the current on each channel and can report this back to the roboRIO via [[CAN]].

The PDP is manufactured by [[CTRE (Cross The Road Electronics)]]. The [[PDH (Power Distribution Hub)]] by [[REV Robotics]] is an alternative FRC-legal power distribution device.
