A period at the start of an FRC match when robots can move autonomouslyâ€”that is, without human intervention. Objectives completed during Autonomous earn more points and can give teams an early lead.

The word "Autonomous" is often shortened to "Auton".

During Autonomous, the drivers must stand behind the starting line and are not allowed to touch the controls. The end of the Autonomous Period is signaled by a buzzer sound, at which point the drivers can step forward. See [[Teleoperated Period (Teleop)]].

The Autonomous Period is typically 15 seconds long.
