The program used to [[Enabled & Disabled|enable]], disable, and control a robot. We also often use the term "driver station" to refer to the computer running the Driver Station program.

The Driver Station program sends joystick information to the robot for [[Teleoperated|teleoperated]] control, and collects logs and metrics from the robot, such as the robot's [[Battery|battery]] level.

**Important notes:**

- Pressing the Enter key will immediately disable the robot, even when the Driver Station program is in the background.
- Pressing the space bar will [[E-Stop (Emergency Stop)]] the robot, even when the Driver Station program is in the background.

**EVEN MORE IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- When operating the robot, ALWAYS follow our [[Enabled & Disabled|enabling procedure]].

The Driver Station program is typically used alongside a [[Dashboard|dashboard]] program such as [[ShuffleBoard]] to display additional robot-specific information and camera images, and to allow the drivers to select an [[Autonomous|autonomous]] routine before the match starts.

The Driver Station program is created by [[National Instruments]] and made available as part of the FRC Game Tools.
