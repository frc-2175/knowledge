The E-Stop is a physical button that forcibly stops all activity on the robot. After pressing E-Stop, the robot will be inoperable and must be rebooted. To be used only when the robot is out of control or otherwise in an emergency situation.

When not hooked up to the [[FMS (Field Managment System)|FMS]], pressing the space bar on the [[Driver Station]] computer will E-Stop the robot.

Not to be confused with the [[A-Stop (Autonomous Stop)]] button.
