When an FRC robot is "enabled", it is actively running the robot program and may move and perform actions. When a robot is "disabled", it is prevented from operating mechanisms, but may still run background portions of the robot program.

When the robot is enabled, the [[RSL (Robot Signal Light)]] will continuously flash. When disabled, the RSL will be solid.

When not connected to the [[FMS (Field Managment System)|FMS]], the robot may be disabled at any time by pressing the Enter key.

**NEVER REACH INSIDE A ROBOT WHEN IT IS ENABLED.** An enabled robot may do anything at any time. Serious injuries may occur if you reach inside an enabled robot.

**ALWAYS RESPECT A ROBOT'S SPACE WHEN IT IS ENABLED.** Robots move quickly and unpredictably, and may reach outside their frame with various mechanisms.

## Enabling procedure

For safety, we always observe the following procedure when enabling the robot:

1. Look at the robot and ensure that no one has any part of their body on or in the robot, or is otherwise actively working on it.
2. **Loudly** say the word "ENABLING!" so that everyone can hear.
3. Enable the robot.
