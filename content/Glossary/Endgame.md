A final objective to perform at the end of the [[Teleoperated Period (Teleop)]], present in most FRC games. Previous endgame objectives have included:

- Climbing (on bars, chains, ropes, platforms, etc.)
- Balancing on seesaws
- Deploying miniature robots to race up poles

The time for endgame objectives is often signaled by a loud noise, such as a train whistle, fanfare, or guitar riff. For details, see the current [[Game Manual]].
