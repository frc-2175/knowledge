The Field Management System is _FIRST_'s field system at competition. It connects to all the teams' [[Driver Station]] computers and [[Enabled & Disabled|enables and disables]] the robots in lockstep. It also connects to field elements, referee consoles, team number displays, etc. and automates the scorekeeping and visuals of the game.

At competition, drivers connect the [[Driver Station]] to the FMS via Ethernet. The FMS then takes over control of the Driver Station.

For technical details of the FMS, see the [FMS whitepaper](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/fms/m/whitepaper/l/608744-fms-whitepaper).
