The one and only official reference for the rules of FRC.

Every year, *FIRST* releases a new version of the game manual at [[Kickoff]]. The manual contains information about the current game, scoring information, gameplay rules, robot safety rules, robot construction requirements, and tournament rules.

All students are expected to read and understand the contents of the game manual.

Before Kickoff, *FIRST* will release an encrypted version of the game manual, which can be downloaded ahead of time to ensure instant access to its contents once the game is announced. The password is released at the end of the Kickoff broadcast.

The current version of the manual, all previous years' manuals, and other game-specific resources can be found here: https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/competition-manual-qa-system

## Updates and questions

*FIRST* may update the game manual throughout the season, e.g. to clarify rules or fix loopholes. When they do so, a Team Update will be published on the manual web page (linked above) and the primary manual PDF will be updated. It is critical to keep up with Team Updates, or else you may act on out-of-date information.

Clarifying questions may only be asked via the official [*FIRST* Q&A System](https://frc-qa.firstinspires.org/). All questions must be submitted by a lead mentor.
