A [[roboRIO]] must be _imaged_ before use. Imaging is the process of installing the roboRIO's firmware, operating system, and other supporting software required for FRC.

The imaging process varies depending on which version of the roboRIO you are imaging:

- [roboRIO 1.0](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-3/imaging-your-roborio.html)
- [roboRIO 2.0](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-3/roborio2-imaging.html)

Both versions require the use of the roboRIO Imaging Tool, installed as part of the [FRC Game Tools](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html) from National Instruments.

*FIRST* may occasionally update the roboRIO image throughout the season, and they require that all robots have an up-to-date version in order to compete. The roboRIO's image version can be found in the [[Driver Station]] program.
