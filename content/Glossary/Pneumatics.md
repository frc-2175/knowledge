Pneumatic mechanisms are those powered by compressed air. FRC robots can use pneumatics to perform a variety of tasks.

The pneumatics subsystem on an FRC robot consists of the following:

- A [[Compressor]]
- Air tanks for storage
- A [[Pressure Regulator]] to restrict the pressure used to operate mechanisms
- [[Air Cylinder|Air cylinders]] to operate mechanisms
- [[Solenoid|Solenoids]] to control the air cylinders
- A [[Pressure Switch]] to shut off the [[Compressor]] when the maximum pressure is reached
- The [[PCM (Pneumatics Control Module)]], which operates the [[Compressor]] and [[Solenoid|Solenoids]]

FRC robots can store compressed air at up to 120 psi, and can operate mechanisms at up to 60 psi. A [[Pressure Regulator]] converts the 120 psi _stored pressure_ to the 60 psi _working pressure_.

Full details about the safe construction of the pneumatics subsystem can be found in the [[Game Manual]].
