A light that indicates the robot's current status to observers. It is a critical safety feature that informs observers when the robot is active.

The RSL may be in one of three states:

- Off: The robot is powered off.
- On (solid): The robot is powered on, but [[Enabled & Disabled|disabled]].
- On (blinking): The robot is powered on and [[Enabled & Disabled|enabled]].

**NEVER REACH INSIDE A ROBOT WHEN THE SIGNAL LIGHT IS BLINKING.** An enabled robot may do anything at any time. Serious injuries may occur if you reach inside an enabled robot.

**ALWAYS RESPECT A ROBOT'S SPACE WHEN THE SIGNAL LIGHT IS BLINKING.** Robots move quickly and unpredictably, and may reach outside their frame with various mechanisms.
