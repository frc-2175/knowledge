The SPARK MAX is most commonly used to control the [[NEO]] and [[NEO 550]] brushless motors. It can also control brushed DC motors such as the [[CIM]] and the [[775pro]].

The SPARK MAX supports multiple control modes, including built-in [[PID (Closed-Loop Control))|closed-loop]] control, and the ability for multiple SPARK MAXes to mirror each other in a leader/follower configuration. It also has a data port on top which can be used with external sensors, such as the [REV Through Bore Encoder](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-1271/) inside a [[MAXSwerve]] module.

The SPARK MAX connects to the [[roboRIO]] via [[CAN]]. It can be configured using the proprietary [REV Hardware Client](https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client).
