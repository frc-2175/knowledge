The second and primary phase of an FRC match, in which robots are remote-controlled by human drivers. (Teleoperated = remotely operated.) The name is commonly shortened to "Teleop".

When the [[Autonomous Period]] ends, a buzzer will sound, at which point human drivers can step forward to take the controls. They remain in control until the end of the match. Teleop often includes an [[Endgame]] objective that unlocks near the end of the match.

In a typical game, Teleop is 2 minutes and 15 seconds long.
