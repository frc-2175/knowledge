The navX combines a gyroscope, accelerometer, and compass into a single highly-accurate sensor. Its primary use is providing a stable and high-quality measurement of the robot's orientation, which is useful for [[Swerve Drive|swerve drive]] and [[Autonomous|autonomous]].

The navX2 is the most common version used in FRC. An older version of the navX was briefly available, but is no longer in common use.
